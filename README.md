Digital Product Development Patterns

# What this is
This is about way of working when designing digital products. It is not a complete framework. It is instead more of a collection of tools and patterns that can be used to enhance or for new ways of working, in established processes. It can adhere to existing way of workings, or processes or frameworks. It is designed to easily be identified where and when to use, how to merge into existing forms of working. The basic architectural principle is the traditional of highly cohesive and loosely coupled.

## So, what are these products then
We do not know yet. But we have a lot of insights, and some hypothesises and we have a way of finding out, via design way of working and continous discovery.
The hypothesis from the above insights and definitions is that competencies such as IT architecture, design movement, agile movement could in the same way as Medici, be brought togehter and even more, should be brought together. The work here suggest different ways of doing this. 

# Content
- 'DialogModel.pdf'. This is a tool that helps in establishing a dialog for product discovery with different stakeholders.

- 'DialogModelTool.drawio'. This is a template for the tool 'Drawio', so to use it, install from drawio.com. 
  - The template guides in providing use-cases, corresponding capabilities with functions, application structure and the business case. Follow the guide in the template.
  

# Theory
This is a description about the theory, mindset, methodology behind these tools.

## About the creative process
The creative process can be seen as having two distinct parts. The insight->idea part where ideas are formed in thoughts and then the second part where these ideas are manifested 'in the world' not necessarily physical objects, it can also be a text, music, services but also real, physical products. This process is described and taught in many different ways, in books, trainings, mentorship, consulting or by hiring different specialists often with their own methods and tools. An insight is however that there besides all this, there is a need for a kind of products which can act as tools that equip people so that they can build a necessary level of skill. The scope is mainly for digital products, and therefore also need to address the specific characteristics of such products, code, systems, systems development, IT architecture, agile and design skills.
Another insight is that there are two disctint activities in product development, that of driving projects and management, and that of the creative process. There is a lof of focus, tools and methods for how to drive and structure development, within the realm of project management, planning, risk management, budget and resources. This is not the focus on these products but on the creative process. Another insight is that development tend to focus a lot on the driving and management activities, and the creative process does not always get necessary space, time, resources. One reason might be that management is in one way easier, there are more people available, and people good at managing and leadning projects are not that skilled in the creative side. Another cause might be that people have a tendency to want to get problem go away, so if some kind of solution is found, go for it instead of broadening the understanding of both problems and solutions.
So the products and tools here, aim at strengthening the creative part, giving it tools and also act as information directed at project leaders and managers how this work is to be done, what is needed, to help give it headroom in projects.

## The Medici Principle as inspiration
During medival times, the Medici family brought together a wide variety of people with different skills, coming from different backgrounds and an experiment started to find out how these capabilities could bring something more, and new together. It worked well, more about it can be read in the book 'The Medici Effect'. In short, the Medici family were good at driving, getting resources and realized that something else was needed for the creative part.

The hypothesis with this work is thet there are lessons from the Medici experiments, to learn also in todays digital product development. An insight is that different capabilities often share similar characteristics even if they are totally different in expression. Another insight is that these different expressions then can affect underlying principles and bring something new to other capabilities. Another insight is that it is possible to bring togehter a wide variety ot totally differnt capabilities, and reap these benefits, it seems to be about creating a culture where they can thrive. 

## Some definitions 
With _capabilities_ is meant some kind of skill, the tools needed and people doing it.
With _IT Architecture_ is meant the broad scope, from enterprise, via business and to solution and software architecture, the people practising, reasearching, learning or teaching, their skills and their roles.
With _Design movement_ is also meant a broad scope. Particulars such as _UX_ and _Service Designers_ and also the methodologies such as _Design Thinking_ and tools such as _Design Sprint_ but also ther more theoretical side, such as _Design Way_ and other work. 
With _Agile Scene_ is again a broad scope but limited to the kind of thriving, more free concept and some methods such as _Scrum_ and _Kanban_ but the main, large frameworks such as _Scaled Agile Framework(SAFE)_ is normally not included in the discussion in this work, if not noted excplicitly.

Some in betweens are _Product Discovery_ by Teresa Torres and also _Continous Product Discovery_ by Tolpagorni which really are good examples of the Medici idea, bringing togehter different capabilities and building new skills.

## Apothegmata as an inspiration
In about 300 A.D. the early Christian church started to emerge within the Roman empire as an effect of Constantins decision to declare Christianity as state religion in Roman Empire. This led to two interesting organisational developments. 
The first was that a group of people started to build a hierachial structure for managing the emerging church, including giving themselves different roles, authority to follow these roles and producing different kind of processes and naturally a lot of textual descriptions, both defining and governing in nature.  
The second was that another group of people fled as far as they could from this emerging organisational work, into the deep deserts of Egypt and surrounding wilderness, to live in caves and simple huts and trying to build the church upon a set of guiding principles that quite soon started to emerge. This group of people became known as 'The Desert Fathers'(for they were mostly, but not entirely, men) Their principles were never really written down, instead their verbal account were collected by disciples and written down, often in very short form because the fathers themselves shyed away form all kind of publicity, and all verbal accounts became short, concentrated, with a strong practical form since they often also let their practical actions show. These collections became known as 'The saying of the desert father' or 'Apophthegmata' in ancient greek.

Later research, mainly by prof Samuel Rubenson, has found that these church fathers were highly organised and that they continued a tradition from mainly the greek academic world. In this process all these various, short 'sentences' or 'sayings' was used to establish the more hierachial church movement, described above. And the other way around, the more hierarchial church affected the desert fathers initiating the monastic movement, building monasteries which over time became one of the main structurs in medieval Europe follwing the fall of Rome.

## Hierachial and network way of organising things
So, take away from this is that there are always two main characteristics of any movement, enterprise, business, organisation, team. One is in hierachial structure and one is network form. They both need each other. However, from innovation, software, digital product development perspective, the network form is better suited and shall have more emphasis than a more hierachial form. This is due to the complex nature of digital solutions and which need an explorative, discovery way of working. One of the most obvious manifestations is between waterfall type of organisations, and agile.

Therefore, this work is called _Digital Product Development Patterns_ and is in the form of Apophthegmatas, short descriptions but also possible to put together in larger forms, or use as is in different frameworks, processes. 

## So how is the Apophthegmata form used in this work and context
The Apophthegmata worked in this way. The established church had their hierachy, different organisational textual descriptions of what people should do and how they should think. This was, as with any large framework, naturally hard to learn and needed a lot of governing, inspection, review mechanisms.
The Apophthegmatas worked the other way around. Short, to thepoint, textual sentences, illustrative, storytelling format reminded, sparked questions and reflections and helped people through creating gravity, urgency, an experienced need. 

Therefore this work adheres to the way of these Apophthegmatas instead of the hierachical, more typical framework way.  

# Another description
This is not a framework, instead more of patterns.
There is aneed for somethning describing Medici perspeict with architecture, design, agile and sydev.
Building in contrast to to hierachial/structure on a more network thikning, loose, and cohjesive.

Draw upon very early school/university ideas emanating from chrush fathers/desert fathers with the APO's etc.
But rish in understanding as in earyl churst was about how to merge strucutre and netwoeik.. I.e these patterns can be used to reflect or be incorportaed in other networks wos in an organisation or just as inspiration. It build heavily on iedas from Edgy and Contious product from Tlopagornig bust just as implement on differneet levels where which some may be on a very high leve. 

# Another inspiration from board games
Board games often build upon very complex mechanisms. They are still possible to play becuase these mechanisms are manifested through artwork, rule cards, boards with graphical content.
This is worth exploring and using.
