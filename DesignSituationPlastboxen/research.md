# Asking about how things are made, from an idea or thought
## Question
to Gemini: 'is there a term or field of research around the activity of making an idea or thought becoming real.'

## Answer
That's a fantastic question, and it touches upon several overlapping and interconnected fields of research and practice. There isn't one single, universally agreed-upon "name of the rule," but here are the closest terms and fields that explore the journey of an idea becoming reality:

**Core Concepts & Terms:**

1.  **Innovation:** This is probably the most direct and widely recognized term. Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay. It involves more than just inventing something new; it's about making that new thing *useful and adopted*.
2.  **Implementation:** This term specifically refers to the process of putting a decision, plan, or idea into effect. While it can apply to various fields, **Implementation Science** is a specific field (especially prominent in healthcare and public policy) that studies methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices and research into routine use.
3.  **Realization / Actualization:** These terms refer to the act of making something real or of coming into being. In a more philosophical or psychological sense, "actualization" relates to making potential a reality.
4.  **Praxeology:** (From Greek "praxis" - action). This is a more philosophical and theoretical field, primarily associated with the Austrian School of economics, that studies human action based on the premise that humans engage in purposeful behavior. It focuses on the logic of action itself, rather than the specific outcomes. While it deals with how humans act to achieve goals, it's less about the *process* of bringing an idea to fruition in a practical, real-world sense of product development or innovation.

**Relevant Fields of Research and Practice:**

* **Innovation Studies:** This is a broad interdisciplinary field that examines the processes by which new ideas, technologies, products, services, and business models are developed, adopted, and diffused. It covers everything from initial ideation to commercialization and societal impact.
* **Entrepreneurship:** This field focuses specifically on the process of designing, launching, and running a new business, which inherently involves taking an idea (often for a new product or service) and making it a commercial reality. Research here looks at factors like opportunity recognition, resource mobilization, risk-taking, and venture creation.
* **Design Thinking / Human-Centered Design:** While a methodology rather than a field of research in itself, "Design Thinking" is heavily researched and practiced. It's an iterative process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) that aims to solve problems by understanding user needs and then bringing solutions to life through practical, hands-on methods like prototyping and testing.
* **Product Development / New Product Development (NPD):** This is a business and engineering discipline focused on the entire process of bringing a new product to market, from concept to launch. It involves design, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing.
* **Project Management:** This discipline provides the tools and techniques to plan, execute, and control work to achieve specific goals and deliver tangible outputs, effectively making ideas real within defined constraints.
* **Action Theory / Theory of Action:** This is a concept in philosophy and social sciences that explores how human intentions translate into actions. It looks at the mental processes and practical steps involved in goal-directed behavior.
* **Praxis:** In philosophy and critical theory, "praxis" refers to the process by which a theory or lesson is enacted, embodied, or realized. It's often contrasted with *poiesis* (making) and *theoria* (theory). It emphasizes the practical application or enactment of ideas.

So, while there isn't one single "rule" with a widely known name like "Murphy's Law" for an idea becoming real, the concept is deeply embedded in the research of **Innovation Studies**, the practice of **Entrepreneurship** and **Product Development**, and the methodologies of **Design Thinking** and **Implementation Science**.

## Answer
Theory of Change and Theory of Action: What's the difference ...
A theory of action focuses on a specific project or program, outlining how it's designed and the actions needed to achieve its intended outcomes. In contrast, a theory of change explores broader, long-term societal changes and how various interventions contribute to those changes. Essentially, a theory of action is a more focused, project-level view, while a theory of change is a more encompassing, systemic view. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown: 
Theory of Action (ToA): 
Scope: Focuses on a specific project or program and its intended outcomes. 
Purpose: Explains how a particular intervention is designed and implemented to achieve desired results. 
Key Questions: "What actions will we take, and how will they lead to our goals?" 
Example: A program designed to increase vaccination rates in a specific community by offering free vaccinations at local clinics. The theory of action would detail the specific steps involved (advertising the clinics, providing transportation, administering vaccines) and how these steps are expected to lead to higher vaccination rates. 
Focus: Primarily concerned with the "how" of achieving a specific objective within a defined context. 
Theory of Change (ToC): 
Scope:
Explores broader, long-term changes within a system or context. 
Purpose:
Explains how a set of actions, strategies, and conditions lead to desired changes in individuals, groups, or communities. 
Key Questions:
"How does change happen in this context, and what are the necessary conditions for it to occur?" 
Example:
A theory of change for a program aimed at improving education in a region might explore how factors like teacher training, curriculum development, parental involvement, and community support all contribute to improved student outcomes and ultimately, to broader societal development. 
Focus:
Emphasizes understanding the underlying mechanisms of change and the interconnectedness of various factors. 
In essence: 
A theory of action is a roadmap for a specific project.
A theory of change is a map of how the world changes and how your project fits within that larger picture. 
Relationship: 
A theory of change can inform the development of a theory of action.
A theory of action is often a specific application of a broader theory of change. 
Example: 
Imagine a program aimed at reducing poverty in a specific region. The theory of change might explore the various factors contributing to poverty in that region (lack of education, limited access to resources, social inequality, etc.) and how these factors interact. The theory of action would then focus on the specific interventions of the program (e.g., job training programs, microfinance initiatives, etc.) and how those interventions, within that particular context, are expected to contribute to poverty reduction.

## Question
via google 'praxis and poiesis'

## Link to answer
https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/65698/what-is-the-difference-between-praxis-and-poiesis

## Answer 1
poiesis - means 'to make'; it is an action that transforms; it refers to 'bringing-forth'; a threshold occasion: a moment of ecstasis when something/s becomes another

praxis - a practice (as distinguished from theory); application of skill; conduct in a public space considered as excellence

## Answer 2
According to Aristotle, there are three basic activities of humans: theoria, poiesis and praxis.

Theoria meant activities that had an end goal of discovering truth. Theoria actions increase one’s knowledge.

Poiesis are activities that have an end goal of production. The activity aims to produce an end that is different from the activity itself.

Praxis are activities whose ends are the actions themselves – there is no other reason in which we engage in these actions (e.g., for greater knowledge or to produce something).1

Another way that Aristotle differentiated between poiesis and praxis is through the distinction between ‘doing’ and ‘making’. In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle wrote that “doing and making are generically different … since making aims at an end distinct from the act of making, whereas in doing, the end cannot be other than the act itself”

Ultimately the distinction between poiesis and praxis/ doing and making is illusory.

Example of Praxis is probably most equivalent to Wu Wei or action of non-action. Spontaneity on the spot at present. Experiencing removal of the boundary of this and that, spontaneity is all there is, whether it is called Poiesis or Praxis or Isness,or awakened…

## Answer
As Bernt Gustavsson has pointed out, theoria, praxis, and poiesis may
overlap, but they nevertheless denote three different discussions of
knowledge.33 In their basic form they represent the activities of man,
aimed at producing different forms of knowledge. These activities have
corresponding virtues of thought. Theoria is associated with episteme—
that is, theoretical/epistemic knowledge of the kind that has already
been discussed, and that tends to be the centre of attention in histories
of knowledge. Praxis is in turn connected to the virtue of phronesis, or
the practical wisdom related to social and political interaction. Poiesis
is linked to techne, or practical/productive knowledge, a knowledge of
how to make something. For Aristotle this was the artisan’s knowledge,
a certain kind of creative skill.34 Practical knowledge is thus divided into
two distinct categories. In the Nicomachean Ethics this is conceptualized
as the capacity to act and the capacity to make:
In the variable are included both things made and things done;
making and acting are different … so that the reasoned state of
capacity to act is different from the reasoned state of capacity to
make. Hence too they are not included one in the other; for neither
is acting making nor is making acting.35
