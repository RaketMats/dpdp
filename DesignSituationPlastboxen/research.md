# Asking about how things are made, from an idea or thought
## Question
to Gemini: 'is there a term or field of research around the activity of making an idea or thought becoming real.'

## Answer
That's a fantastic question, and it touches upon several overlapping and interconnected fields of research and practice. There isn't one single, universally agreed-upon "name of the rule," but here are the closest terms and fields that explore the journey of an idea becoming reality:

**Core Concepts & Terms:**

1.  **Innovation:** This is probably the most direct and widely recognized term. Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay. It involves more than just inventing something new; it's about making that new thing *useful and adopted*.
2.  **Implementation:** This term specifically refers to the process of putting a decision, plan, or idea into effect. While it can apply to various fields, **Implementation Science** is a specific field (especially prominent in healthcare and public policy) that studies methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices and research into routine use.
3.  **Realization / Actualization:** These terms refer to the act of making something real or of coming into being. In a more philosophical or psychological sense, "actualization" relates to making potential a reality.
4.  **Praxeology:** (From Greek "praxis" - action). This is a more philosophical and theoretical field, primarily associated with the Austrian School of economics, that studies human action based on the premise that humans engage in purposeful behavior. It focuses on the logic of action itself, rather than the specific outcomes. While it deals with how humans act to achieve goals, it's less about the *process* of bringing an idea to fruition in a practical, real-world sense of product development or innovation.

**Relevant Fields of Research and Practice:**

* **Innovation Studies:** This is a broad interdisciplinary field that examines the processes by which new ideas, technologies, products, services, and business models are developed, adopted, and diffused. It covers everything from initial ideation to commercialization and societal impact.
* **Entrepreneurship:** This field focuses specifically on the process of designing, launching, and running a new business, which inherently involves taking an idea (often for a new product or service) and making it a commercial reality. Research here looks at factors like opportunity recognition, resource mobilization, risk-taking, and venture creation.
* **Design Thinking / Human-Centered Design:** While a methodology rather than a field of research in itself, "Design Thinking" is heavily researched and practiced. It's an iterative process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) that aims to solve problems by understanding user needs and then bringing solutions to life through practical, hands-on methods like prototyping and testing.
* **Product Development / New Product Development (NPD):** This is a business and engineering discipline focused on the entire process of bringing a new product to market, from concept to launch. It involves design, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing.
* **Project Management:** This discipline provides the tools and techniques to plan, execute, and control work to achieve specific goals and deliver tangible outputs, effectively making ideas real within defined constraints.
* **Action Theory / Theory of Action:** This is a concept in philosophy and social sciences that explores how human intentions translate into actions. It looks at the mental processes and practical steps involved in goal-directed behavior.
* **Praxis:** In philosophy and critical theory, "praxis" refers to the process by which a theory or lesson is enacted, embodied, or realized. It's often contrasted with *poiesis* (making) and *theoria* (theory). It emphasizes the practical application or enactment of ideas.

So, while there isn't one single "rule" with a widely known name like "Murphy's Law" for an idea becoming real, the concept is deeply embedded in the research of **Innovation Studies**, the practice of **Entrepreneurship** and **Product Development**, and the methodologies of **Design Thinking** and **Implementation Science**.

## Question
via Google 'Theory of action vs theory of change'

## Answer
Theory of Change and Theory of Action: What's the difference ...
A theory of action focuses on a specific project or program, outlining how it's designed and the actions needed to achieve its intended outcomes. In contrast, a theory of change explores broader, long-term societal changes and how various interventions contribute to those changes. Essentially, a theory of action is a more focused, project-level view, while a theory of change is a more encompassing, systemic view. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown: 
Theory of Action (ToA): 
Scope: Focuses on a specific project or program and its intended outcomes. 
Purpose: Explains how a particular intervention is designed and implemented to achieve desired results. 
Key Questions: "What actions will we take, and how will they lead to our goals?" 
Example: A program designed to increase vaccination rates in a specific community by offering free vaccinations at local clinics. The theory of action would detail the specific steps involved (advertising the clinics, providing transportation, administering vaccines) and how these steps are expected to lead to higher vaccination rates. 
Focus: Primarily concerned with the "how" of achieving a specific objective within a defined context. 
Theory of Change (ToC): 
Scope:
Explores broader, long-term changes within a system or context. 
Purpose:
Explains how a set of actions, strategies, and conditions lead to desired changes in individuals, groups, or communities. 
Key Questions:
"How does change happen in this context, and what are the necessary conditions for it to occur?" 
Example:
A theory of change for a program aimed at improving education in a region might explore how factors like teacher training, curriculum development, parental involvement, and community support all contribute to improved student outcomes and ultimately, to broader societal development. 
Focus:
Emphasizes understanding the underlying mechanisms of change and the interconnectedness of various factors. 
In essence: 
A theory of action is a roadmap for a specific project.
A theory of change is a map of how the world changes and how your project fits within that larger picture. 
Relationship: 
A theory of change can inform the development of a theory of action.
A theory of action is often a specific application of a broader theory of change. 
Example: 
Imagine a program aimed at reducing poverty in a specific region. The theory of change might explore the various factors contributing to poverty in that region (lack of education, limited access to resources, social inequality, etc.) and how these factors interact. The theory of action would then focus on the specific interventions of the program (e.g., job training programs, microfinance initiatives, etc.) and how those interventions, within that particular context, are expected to contribute to poverty reduction.

## Question
via google 'praxis and poiesis'

## Link to answer
https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/65698/what-is-the-difference-between-praxis-and-poiesis

## Answer 1
poiesis - means 'to make'; it is an action that transforms; it refers to 'bringing-forth'; a threshold occasion: a moment of ecstasis when something/s becomes another

praxis - a practice (as distinguished from theory); application of skill; conduct in a public space considered as excellence

## Answer 2
According to Aristotle, there are three basic activities of humans: theoria, poiesis and praxis.

Theoria meant activities that had an end goal of discovering truth. Theoria actions increase one’s knowledge.

Poiesis are activities that have an end goal of production. The activity aims to produce an end that is different from the activity itself.

Praxis are activities whose ends are the actions themselves – there is no other reason in which we engage in these actions (e.g., for greater knowledge or to produce something).1

Another way that Aristotle differentiated between poiesis and praxis is through the distinction between ‘doing’ and ‘making’. In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle wrote that “doing and making are generically different … since making aims at an end distinct from the act of making, whereas in doing, the end cannot be other than the act itself”

Ultimately the distinction between poiesis and praxis/ doing and making is illusory.

Example of Praxis is probably most equivalent to Wu Wei or action of non-action. Spontaneity on the spot at present. Experiencing removal of the boundary of this and that, spontaneity is all there is, whether it is called Poiesis or Praxis or Isness,or awakened…

Stored under /Docs/Design/Circulation_of_knowledge.pdf'

## Answer
As Bernt Gustavsson has pointed out, theoria, praxis, and poiesis may
overlap, but they nevertheless denote three different discussions of
knowledge.33 In their basic form they represent the activities of man,
aimed at producing different forms of knowledge. These activities have
corresponding virtues of thought. Theoria is associated with episteme—
that is, theoretical/epistemic knowledge of the kind that has already
been discussed, and that tends to be the centre of attention in histories
of knowledge. Praxis is in turn connected to the virtue of phronesis, or
the practical wisdom related to social and political interaction. Poiesis
is linked to techne, or practical/productive knowledge, a knowledge of
how to make something. For Aristotle this was the artisan’s knowledge,
a certain kind of creative skill.34 Practical knowledge is thus divided into
two distinct categories. In the Nicomachean Ethics this is conceptualized
as the capacity to act and the capacity to make:
In the variable are included both things made and things done;
making and acting are different … so that the reasoned state of
capacity to act is different from the reasoned state of capacity to
make. Hence too they are not included one in the other; for neither
is acting making nor is making acting.35

## Question
Gemini: 'what is an actant'

## Answer
The term "**actant**" is most famously associated with **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)**, a sociological and philosophical framework developed primarily by Bruno Latour, Michel Callon, and John Law. However, its origins can also be traced back to semiotics and narrative theory.

Here's a breakdown of what an actant means, particularly in the context of ANT:

**In Actor-Network Theory (ANT):**

In ANT, an actant is **anything that acts or to which activity is granted by others**. The crucial part is that an actant can be **human or non-human**.

The core idea of ANT, and therefore the concept of actants, challenges traditional sociological views that primarily focus on human agency. ANT argues that the social world is made up of complex "networks" or "assemblages" where both human and non-human elements play active roles in shaping outcomes.

Key characteristics of actants in ANT:

1.  **Generalized Symmetry:** ANT proposes that humans and non-humans should be analyzed using the same terms and given equal analytical weight. There's no inherent hierarchy where humans are seen as the sole drivers of action.
2.  **Source of Action/Influence:** An actant is anything that "makes a difference" or "modifies a state of affairs." This can be:
    * **Humans:** Individuals, groups, organizations.
    * **Objects/Technologies:** A door, a computer, a light switch, a vaccine, a specific piece of software.
    * **Ideas/Concepts:** A scientific theory, a management principle, a political ideology.
    * **Natural Phenomena:** Weather, gravity, microbes, a river.
3.  **Agency without Intentionality:** This is often the most challenging aspect to grasp. Non-human actants don't have consciousness, will, or intention like humans do, but they still exert influence and shape events.
    * *Example:* A speed bump (non-human actant) forces a driver (human actant) to slow down. The speed bump isn't "trying" to make you slow down, but its physical presence has a direct effect on your behavior. Microbes (non-human actants) cause fermentation or disease, acting within their biological properties and shaping human actions (e.g., Pasteur's work).
4.  **Relational:** An actant's "agency" isn't inherent in isolation but emerges from its relationships and interactions within a network. An object only "acts" in relation to other objects and humans.
5.  **Assemblages:** Actants come together to form assemblages or networks. These networks are constantly being built, maintained, and sometimes dismantled through the interactions of the actants within them.

**In Semiotics and Narrative Theory (pre-dating ANT):**

The term "actant" was originally introduced by the linguist Lucien Tesnière in grammar and later popularized in semiotics and narrative theory by figures like A.J. Greimas. In this context, an actant refers to a **structural role** in a narrative, rather than a specific character.

* Greimas's "actantial model" identified six universal actants (pairs of binary oppositions) that drive a narrative:
    * Subject / Object (who desires what?)
    * Sender / Receiver (who initiates the quest / who benefits?)
    * Helper / Opponent (who aids / who hinders?)

Here, an "actant" is a functional position that can be filled by various characters, objects, or even abstract forces (e.g., "fate" could be an opponent). The specific character is called an "acteur."

**In summary:**

While "actant" has roots in linguistics and semiotics, its most prominent usage today, particularly in academic and critical discourse, refers to its definition within **Actor-Network Theory**, where it signifies **anything (human or non-human) that plays an active and influential role in a network of relationships, affecting outcomes and shaping reality.**

## Question
About the real things, that mimesis is a representation of
Gemini 'in greek philosophy mimesis is representation of something, what is the term for the real thing'

## Answer
In Greek philosophy, particularly in the context of Plato and Aristotle's discussions on **mimesis** (representation or imitation), the "real thing" being represented is often referred to by a few related terms, depending on the specific philosophical nuance:

1.  **Idea (ἰδέα) / Form (εἶδος):**
    * This is the most common and central concept, especially for **Plato**. For Plato, the true "real things" are the eternal, unchanging, perfect **Forms** (or Ideas) that exist in a transcendent realm.
    * Physical objects in our world are merely imperfect copies or imitations (mimesis) of these perfect Forms.
    * Art, in turn, is a *mimesis of a mimesis* – an imitation of an imitation – and thus twice removed from true reality. So, if a painter paints a bed, they are imitating a physical bed, which itself is an imitation of the perfect Form of "Bed-ness."

2.  **Reality (ἀλήθεια - *aletheia* - truth/reality, or ὄν - *on* - being):**
    * More broadly, "reality" refers to that which truly exists and is being represented. For Plato, true reality is the realm of Forms. For Aristotle, reality is found within the sensible world itself, and mimesis in art can reveal universal truths about that reality.

3.  **Nature (φύσις - *physis*):**
    * Especially in **Aristotle's** philosophy, mimesis is often understood as the imitation of *physis*, or nature. However, Aristotle's view is not simply copying. He believed that art imitates nature not just by mirroring it, but by representing its *processes* and *universal principles*, often refining or idealizing what is found in nature. So, a poet imitating human action is imitating a "real thing" in human nature.

**In summary:**

While **mimesis** is the *representation*, the **"real thing"** it represents is most directly the **Idea** or **Form** (for Plato) or, more broadly, **Reality** or **Nature** (especially for Aristotle, who saw art as engaging with the universal aspects of the world).

## Question
About what a real thing, a product is called
Gemini 'ut what is a real object, a product, like a hammer called'

## Answer
Got it. If we're talking about a **real, tangible object or product** like a hammer, within the context of **Plato's philosophy** and his theory of Forms/Ideas, a physical hammer would be considered:

1.  **A particular instance of a Form:** It's an imperfect, mutable, and perishable **copy (or imitation/mimesis)** of the eternal and perfect **Form of Hammer-ness** (or the Idea of a Hammer). The true "Hammer" exists only as an ideal concept in the realm of Forms.
2.  **A "sensible" object:** It exists in the **sensible world** (the world we perceive with our senses), which Plato viewed as a world of shadows and reflections of the true reality.
3.  **A product of *poiesis*:** This is a Greek term that means "making" or "production." A craftsman (like a blacksmith) engages in *poiesis* to create a physical hammer. This act of making is guided by their understanding (however imperfect) of the Form of the Hammer.

So, for Plato, a physical hammer isn't the "real thing" in the ultimate sense; it's a **physical manifestation, a copy, or an instance** of the true, ideal Form.

For **Aristotle**, on the other hand, the physical hammer *is* real. Its "form" (essence) is inherent within the matter of the hammer itself, and its purpose (to hammer) is part of its nature. Mimesis in art for Aristotle would involve representing something like the *action* of hammering, or the *essence* of a tool, which is part of the reality of the sensible world.

## Question
About the specific word Aristotle would use
Gemini 'so what is that aristotle word for e.g. a hammer'

## Answer
For Aristotle, a real, tangible object like a hammer is considered a **substance** (Greek: **ousia**, οὐσία).

Here's why and what that entails for him:

1.  **Primary Substance (ousia):** For Aristotle, individual, concrete things like "this man," "this horse," or "this hammer" are primary substances. They are fundamental existents that do not depend on anything else for their being (unlike qualities like "redness" or "heaviness," which must inhere in a substance). A hammer *is* a hammer; it doesn't exist *in* something else as a property of that thing.

2.  **Hylomorphism (Matter and Form):** Aristotle believed that every physical substance is a composite of **matter** (hylē) and **form** (eidos or morphē).
    * **Matter:** The raw stuff out of which something is made (e.g., the metal and wood that make up the hammer). Matter is potentiality.
    * **Form:** The "whatness" or essence of the thing; its structure, organization, and defining characteristics that make it what it is (e.g., the specific shape and arrangement of the metal head and wooden handle that make it a hammer and give it its function). Form is actuality.
    A hammer is a hammer because its matter has been given the form of a hammer. You cannot separate the form from the matter in a physical object; they are intrinsically linked.

3.  **Four Causes:** When explaining *why* a hammer is a hammer, Aristotle would refer to his **Four Causes**:
    * **Material Cause:** What it's made of (e.g., steel and wood).
    * **Formal Cause:** Its shape, structure, and essence (the blueprint or design of a hammer, what makes it identifiable as a hammer).
    * **Efficient Cause:** What brought it into being (e.g., the blacksmith or factory worker who manufactured it).
    * **Final Cause:** Its purpose or telos (e.g., to pound nails, to build things).

So, while Plato would say a physical hammer is just a flawed copy of the true "Form of Hammer," Aristotle would say that the physical hammer itself *is* a **substance**, and its reality is fully comprehensible through its inherent matter and form, and by understanding its four causes.

## Question about where to read more about this
Gemini 'are there any books by Aristotle describing this, and that I can read or any other book by someone else describing this'

## Answer
You're asking about some of the deepest and most complex aspects of Aristotle's philosophy! His ideas on substance, matter, and form are central to his metaphysics and have influenced Western thought for millennia.

Here are the key works by Aristotle himself and some excellent secondary sources that can help you understand these concepts:

### Aristotle's Primary Works (Directly addressing Substance, Matter, and Form)

1.  **"Metaphysics" (especially Books VII, VIII, and IX, also known as Zeta, Eta, and Theta):**
    * **Why it's key:** This is *the* central text where Aristotle extensively develops his theory of **substance (ousia)**, hylomorphism (matter and form), potentiality and actuality, and the four causes. He critiques Plato's theory of Forms here and lays out his own understanding of what fundamental reality is.
    * **Challenge:** The *Metaphysics* is notoriously difficult. It's a collection of Aristotle's lectures and notes, not a polished book, and some parts are highly technical and abstract. It's often recommended to read it with a good commentary.

2.  **"Categories":**
    * **Why it's key:** This is an earlier work, but it's where Aristotle first introduces his concept of **primary substance** (like "this man" or "this horse," or "this hammer") as the fundamental bearer of properties. He contrasts these with "secondary substances" (species and genera, like "man" or "animal") and "accidents" (qualities, quantities, relations, etc., like "white" or "tall"). It's a foundational text for understanding his ontology (the study of being).
    * **Accessibility:** "Categories" is generally much shorter and more accessible than "Metaphysics" and is often a good starting point for understanding his theory of substance.

3.  **"Physics" (especially Books I, II, and III):**
    * **Why it's key:** This work explores change, motion, nature (*physis*), and the principles underlying the natural world. It's here that he introduces and discusses **matter (hylē)** and **form (eidos)** as the explanatory principles of change. Hylomorphism is very much developed here to explain how things come into being and change while retaining their identity.
    * **Accessibility:** Like "Metaphysics," "Physics" can be challenging due to its philosophical and scientific depth.

### Recommended Secondary Sources (Books by Others Explaining Aristotle)

Since Aristotle's own texts can be dense, it's often very helpful to read scholarly introductions and commentaries.

**For a general introduction to Aristotle's thought:**

* **"Aristotle: The Desire to Understand" by Jonathan Lear:** This is a highly regarded philosophical introduction that covers Aristotle's metaphysics, physics, ethics, and more, written in clear prose.
* **"Aristotle's Way" by Edith Hall:** While it has a strong focus on ethics, it's a very accessible book that connects Aristotle's ideas to modern life, and will touch on how he viewed reality and human flourishing. It's a good entry point for a popular audience.
* **"A New Aristotle Reader" by J.L. Ackrill:** A classic collection of key passages from Aristotle's works, often with helpful introductions, though it's still primary text.

**Specifically on Substance, Matter, and Form (Hylomorphism):**

* **"Aristotle's Theory of Substance: The Categories and Metaphysics Zeta" by Michael V. Wedin:** This is a more academic book that dives deep into the coherence and development of Aristotle's substance theory across these two crucial texts. Might be more suitable after you've grasped the basics.
* **"The Activity of Being: An Essay on Aristotle's Ontology" by Aryeh Kosman:** A more recent and influential interpretation of Aristotle's metaphysics, particularly focusing on the concept of actuality.
* **"The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle" edited by Jonathan Barnes:** This is an excellent collection of essays by leading scholars, with dedicated chapters on his metaphysics, logic, and philosophy of nature that will address substance and hylomorphism. It's comprehensive but can be dense.
* **The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Online):** This is not a book, but an invaluable free online resource. Look up entries like "Aristotle's Metaphysics," "Aristotle's Categories," "Form vs. Matter," and "Substance." These articles are written by experts and provide concise, well-structured overviews with bibliographies. They are often a great starting point before diving into full books.

**How to approach reading Aristotle:**

* **Start with "Categories"**: It's shorter and introduces primary substance clearly.
* **Move to a good introduction**: A book like Lear's or Hall's can give you the broader context and prepare you for the more difficult texts.
* **Tackle "Metaphysics" with a commentary**: Don't be afraid to use a scholarly commentary or study guide alongside the main text. Readings from Book VII (Zeta) are particularly important for substance.
* **Don't expect a linear argument**: Aristotle's works are often more like a philosophical exploration than a systematic treatise.

Enjoy the journey into Aristotelian thought! It's incredibly rich and rewarding.

## Question about experience
Here I realized that episteme, phronesis etc. need 'experience', to experience what is happening and move on to knowledge, judgement whether a prototype is good or bad etc. 
Gemini 'In aristoteles thinking, experience things, experience reality must have been important'

## Answer
You are absolutely correct! In Aristotle's thinking, **experience (empeiria - ἐμπειρία)** and the direct observation of reality through the senses were **fundamentally important** to the acquisition of knowledge. This is a key way he differed from his teacher, Plato.

Here's why experience was so crucial for Aristotle:

1.  **Rejection of Innate Ideas (Plato's Forms):** Unlike Plato, who believed that true knowledge was of eternal, non-sensible Forms and that our sensory experience was misleading, Aristotle argued that there are no innate ideas in the mind. The mind, at birth, is like a "blank slate" (though not quite in the Lockean sense, but a potentiality for knowledge). All knowledge must ultimately begin with sensory perception.

2.  **Foundation of Knowledge:** For Aristotle, the process of acquiring knowledge begins with:
    * **Perception (aisthesis - αἴσθησις):** We perceive individual, particular objects and events through our senses. "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses" is a famous dictum attributed to Scholastic Aristotelians, perfectly capturing this idea.
    * **Memory (mneme - μνήμη):** Repeated perceptions of the same kind of thing lead to memories.
    * **Experience (empeiria - ἐμπειρία):** When many memories of the same kind of thing accumulate, we develop "experience." This is more than just individual perceptions; it's a unified grasp of what is common across many particular instances. For example, seeing many individual fires and observing that they are hot leads to the experience that "fire is hot."

3.  **Path to Universal Knowledge (Induction):** Experience, in turn, is the stepping stone to higher forms of knowledge like **art/skill (technē - τέχνη)** and **science (epistēmē - ἐπιστήμη)**. Through a process of **induction (epagōgē - ἐπαγωγή)**, we move from the many particular experiences to grasp universal principles.
    * A doctor has "experience" if they know that a certain remedy cures a certain patient.
    * But they have "art" (technē) when they understand *why* that remedy works for *all* patients with that condition, grasping the universal principle.
    * Science (epistēmē) aims for even deeper, demonstrable knowledge of causes and principles.

4.  **Emphasis on the Sensible World:** Aristotle believed that true reality resides in the individual substances of the sensible world (the world we perceive). To understand reality, therefore, you must study these individual things, their properties, and their changes through observation and experience. His extensive biological works, where he meticulously observed and classified animals and plants, are prime examples of his empiricist methodology.

5.  **Practical Wisdom (Phronesis):** Experience is also critical for **practical wisdom (phronesis)**, which is the intellectual virtue concerned with knowing how to act rightly in particular situations. You can't learn phronesis purely from theoretical rules; it requires extensive real-world experience to develop good judgment and the ability to apply general ethical principles to specific, often messy, circumstances.

In summary, for Aristotle, sensory experience is not a distraction from truth, but the **necessary starting point and raw material for all genuine knowledge**. It provides the empirical data from which the mind abstracts universals, builds understanding, and develops both theoretical wisdom and practical judgment.
